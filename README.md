Loading the data into a new power query editor.
Deleting some uneccesary columns and removing duplicates and then changing some data types.
Making different relation in data to understand what picture they can paint.
Choosing the correct and best sutaible charts for different types/columns data to make the dashboard.
Editing the various features of charts to change colors, sizes, etc. to make it attractive and eyecatchy.
Completing the enire dashboard and attaching its screenshot(pdf) in the repository.
The whole project was conducted in Power Bi app and the use of youtube and google was crried out for research.
Todays task gave me an opportunity to learn various ways to make table connections and handling large datasets and a few differnt ways to clean and process it. It was quite insightful and will definitely help me improve my powerbi dashboard skill.
